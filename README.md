Predict the leptospirosis status of the patients:
This leptospirosis status of the patients dataset consists medical data of 1387 patients and 806 variables.
Identified crucial factors that are associated with response variable (status of the patient whether confirmed or not detected) and the relationships among those factors to detect when changes are made to the factors influencing it. 
 Fitted suitable classification models to the dataset and continued with the model having highest accuracy. For improving the model accuracy used the Lasso and Ridge regularization methods.
